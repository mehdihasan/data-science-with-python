## Summary
We are looking for answer of the following question:

>> How can we determine a fair value for a used car?


## Learning Objectives
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation using Visualization 
- Polynomial Regression and Pipelines
- R-squared and MSE for In-Sample Evaluation 
- Prediction and Decision Making


## Model Development
- A model or estimator can be thought of as a mathematical equation used to predict a
value given one or more other values.  
- Relating one or more independent variables or features to dependent variables.


## Simple & Multiple Linear Regression

### SLR: Simple Linear Regression
1. The predictor (independent) variable - __x__ 
2. The target (dependent) variable - __y__

y = b0 + b1x

b0: the intercept
b1: the slope
